# Year Two Lecture Notes

This is where I dump my lecture notes taken during my second year at Imperial College London.
I have omitted most introductions, motivations, applications and examples (so it serves the purpose of a handbook, not learning material). 

All of the notes are currently incomplete and I will update them regularly.
