\section{Real Analysis in Higher
Dimensions}\label{real-analysis-in-higher-dimensions}}

We continue on first-year analysis in higher dimensions.

\hypertarget{euclidean-spaces}{%
\subsection{Euclidean Spaces}\label{euclidean-spaces}}

For \(n \ge 1\), the \(n\)-dimensional \emph{Euclidean space} denoted by
\(\mathbb{R}^n\), is the set of ordered \(n\)-tuples
\(\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n)\) for \(x_i \in \mathbb{R}\).
Recall that \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is a vector space over \(\mathbb{R}\), we
can use the usual vector space operations, i.e.~vector addition and
scalar multiplication. Furthermore, \(\mathbb{R}^n\) forms a inner
product space with the operation, \[
  \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to 
  \mathbb{R} : (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) \mapsto \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i y_i.
\] Thus, as a inner product space induces a normed vector space, we find
a natural norm defined for \(\mathbb{R}^n\) by, \[
  \| \cdot \| : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} : \mathbf{x} \mapsto 
  \sqrt{\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x} \rangle} = \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2}.
\] By manually checking, we find that this norm satisfy the norm axioms,
i.e.~it satisfy the \emph{triangle inequality}, is \emph{absolutely
scalable}, and \emph{positive definite} (In fact, we do not need the
norm to be non-negative as it can deduced from the other axioms).

\hypertarget{preliminary-concepts-in-mathbbrn}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Preliminary Concepts in
\(\mathbb{R}^n\)}{Preliminary Concepts in \textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^{}n}}\label{preliminary-concepts-in-mathbbrn}}

Sequences in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) can be defined similarly to that of
\(\mathbb{R}\), and we carry over all notations in all suitable places.

\begin{definition}[Convergence in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)]
  We say a sequence \((\mathbf{x}_i)_{i = 1}^\infty \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) 
  converges to \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) if and only if for all 
  \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists some \(N \in \mathbb{N}\) such that for all 
  \(i \ge N\), \(\|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}\| < \epsilon\).
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
  A sequence \((\mathbf{x}_i)_{i = 1}^\infty \in \mathbb{R}^n\) converges to 
  \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) if and only if each component of 
  \(\mathbf{x}_i\) converges to the corresponding component of \(\mathbf{x}\).
\end{prop}

In the first dimension, we've considered the topology of \(\mathbb{R}\)
including the examination of open and closed sets. We extend this idea
for higher dimensions. The most basic examples we have of an open set
(or closed set for that matter) in \(\mathbb{R}\) are the open and
closed intervals respectively. This is extended in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) to
be sets of the form \[
  \prod_{i = 1}^n (a_i, b_i) := \{\mathbf{x} \mid a_i < \mathbf{x}_i < b_i, 
  \forall 1 \le i \le n\},
\] and similarly for closed intervals. However, while this is nice to
look at, it is not very useful. So for this reason, we again will extend
the notion of open and closed sets for \(\mathbb{R}^n\).

\begin{definition} [Open Ball]
  Let \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n\) and \(r \in \mathbb{R}^+\), we define the 
  open ball of radius \(r\) about \(\mathbf{x}\) as the set 
  \[B_r(\mathbf{x}) := \{\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid 
  \| \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\| < r\}\].
\end{definition}
\begin{definition} [Open]
  A set \(U \subseteq \mathbb{  R}^n\) is open in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) if and only if 
  for all \(\mathbf{x} \in U\), there is some \(r \in \mathbb{R}^+\) such that 
  \(B_r(\mathbf{x}) \subseteq U\).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Closed]
  A set \(U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) is closed if and only if its complement is 
  open.
\end{definition}

Straight away from the definition, we can see that every open ball is
open (see
\href{https://github.com/JasonKYi/learn_mspaces/blob/master/src/metric_spaces/basic.lean\#L215}{here}).
Furthermore, we find the union and intersection of two open sets is
open. In fact, the union and any collection of open sets is also open,
however, this is not necessarily true for closed sets.

\begin{definition} [Continuity at a Point]
  Let \(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) be an open set, and let 
  \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}^m\). We say \(f\) is continuous at \(p \in A\) if and 
  only if for all \(\epsilon > 0\) there exists \(\delta > 0\) such that for all 
  \(x \in A \cap B_\delta(p)\), \(\| f(x) - f(p) \| < \epsilon\).
\end{definition}

If the function \(f\) is continuous at every point of \(A\), then we say
\(f\) is continuous on \(A\).

\begin{definition}
  Let \(A \in \mathbb{R}^n\) be open in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and let 
  \(f : A \to \mathbb{R}^m\). For \(p \in A\), we say that the limit of \(f\) as 
  \(\mathbf{x}\) tends to \(\mathbf{p}\) in \(A\) is equal to 
  \(\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^m\) if and only if for all \(\epsilon > 0\), there 
  exists \(\delta > 0\) such that for all \(x \in A \cap B_\delta(p), x \neq p\),
  \(\|f(x) - \mathbf{q}\| < \epsilon\).
\end{definition}

This is the same notion we used for continuity in the first dimension to
say that \(f\) is continuous at \(p\) if and only if
\(\lim_{x \to p} f(x) = q\).

\begin{prop}
  Let \(f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m\) be a function. Then \(f\) is 
  continuous if and only if for all open subsets \(U\) of \(\mathbb{R}^m\), 
  \(f^{-1}(U)\) is open in \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
\end{prop}
\proof

See
\href{https://github.com/JasonKYi/learn_mspaces/blob/master/src/metric_spaces/basic.lean\#L257}{here}
for the proof. \qed

\hypertarget{derivative-of-maps-in-euclidean-spaces}{%
\subsubsection{Derivative of Maps in Euclidean
Spaces}\label{derivative-of-maps-in-euclidean-spaces}}

Let \(\Omega\) be a open in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), and
\(f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^m\) be a ``nice behaving map''. We poses the
question on how we should define the notion of derivatives for this
mapping at some point \(p \in \Omega\). We recall that the derivative at
a point \(p\) in the first dimension is defined to be
\[f'(p) = \lim_{x \to p}\frac{f(x) - f(p)}{x - p}.\] While we see that
this equation makes no sense if we simply generalise this equation to
higher dimensions, we see the following result.

\begin{lemma}
  Let \(f : S \to \mathbb{R}\) where \(S \subseteq \mathbb{R}\), then \(f\) is 
  differentiable at some \(p \in S\) if and only if there exists some 
  \(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}\) such that 
  \[\lim_{x \to p} \left|\frac{f(x) - A_\lambda(x)}{x - p}\right| = 0,\]
  where \(A_\lambda(x) = \lambda(x - p) + f(p)\).
\end{lemma}
\proof

Follows from algebraic manipulation. \qed

With this, we can conclude that \(f(x) - A_\lambda(x)\) tends to zero
faster than \(x - p\). We will generalise this result to higher
dimensions.

We may rewrite
\(A_\lambda(x) = \lambda(x - p) + f(p) = \lambda x + (f(p) + \lambda p)\),
so, we see that \(\lambda\) is the translation of a linear map
\(\lambda x\),
i.e.~\(A_\lambda = (x \mapsto x + (f(p) + \lambda p)) \circ (x \mapsto \lambda x)\).
We can easily generalise such maps to higher dimensions and we call such
maps \emph{affine maps}.

\begin{definition}[Differentiable Functions in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)]
  Recall the definition of linear maps for general vector spaces which we will 
  use in the context of Euclidean spaces. Let \(L(\mathbb{R}^n; \mathbb{R}^m)\) 
  denote the set of linear maps from \(\mathbb{R}^n\) to \(\mathbb{R}^m\), 
  \(\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) be open, and \(f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^m\) 
  be a function. Then we say \(f\) is differentiable at some point 
  \(p \in \Omega\) if and only if there exists some 
  \(\Lambda \in L(\mathbb{R}^n; \mathbb{R}^m)\), such that 
  \[ \lim_{x \to p} \frac{\| f(x) - (\Lambda(x - p) + f(p))\|}{\|x - p\|} = 0.
  \]
  If this is true, we write \(Df(p) = \Lambda\) and call \(\Lambda\) the 
  derivative of \(f\) at \(p\).
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  Some book refers to \(Df(p)\) as the total derivative of \(f\) at \(p\).
\end{remark}

It is often useful to express the derivative criterion as
\[\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\|f(p + h) - f(p) - \Lambda(h)\|}{\| h \|} = 0.\]

\begin{prop}
  Let \(f_i : (a, b) \to \mathbb{R}\) be differentiable for all \(i\), then the 
  function, \(f : (a, b) \to \mathbb{R}^m : x \mapsto (f_i(x))_{i = 1}^m\) is 
  differentiable for all \(p \in (a, b)\).
\end{prop}
\proof

Let the Jacobian \(\Lambda = \text{diag}(\lambda_i)\) where
\(\lambda_i\) is the derivative of \(f_i\) at \(p\). Then I claim,
\(Df(p) = \Lambda p\).

Consider
\[\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\|f(p + h) - f(p) - \Lambda h\|}{\| h \|} = 
  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i = 0}^m \left|f_i(p + h) - f_i(p) - \lambda_i h\right|}}
  {\| h \|}.\] However, for all \(i\),
\(\| h \| \ge \left| h_i \right|\), so \[ \lim_{h \to 0}
  \frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i = 0}^m \left|f_i(p + h) - f_i(p) - \lambda_i h\right|}}
  {\| h \|} \le \lim_{h \to 0} \sum_{i = 0}^m
  \sqrt{\frac{\left|f_i(p + h) - f_i(p) - \lambda_i h\right|}
  {\left| h_i \right|}} = 0\] \qed

A lot of results from the first dimension generalises easily to higher
dimensions. Similar to that of the first dimension, the chain rule in
general Euclidean spaces states,

\begin{theorem}
  Let \(\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) and \(\Omega' \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m\) 
  be open sets with \(g : \Omega \to \Omega'\) be differentiable at \(p \in \Omega\) 
  and \(f : \Omega' \to \mathbb{R}^l\) be derivatives at \(g(p)\). Then 
  \(h = f \circ g\) is differentiable at \(p\) with derivative 
  \[Dh(p) = Df(g(p)) \circ Dg(p).\] 
\end{theorem}
\proof

Similar to the proof of the Chain rule in the first dimension using
algebraic manipulation. \qed

Omitted many examples here, check official lecture notes for these
examples.

\hypertarget{directional-derivatives}{%
\subsubsection{Directional Derivatives}\label{directional-derivatives}}

Although the definition of derivative in dimension one and higher is
similar, it is different in that we verify whether a linear map is the
total derivative at a point instead of computing the limit of some
equation. This is difficult as often times, it is not easy to guess what
the derivative of a function is. Thus, it is useful to somehow identify
candidate linear maps for the derivative.

Assume \(\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) is open and
\(f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^m\) is a differentiable function at some
\(p \in \Omega\). Let \(v \in \mathbb{R}^n\) be a unit vector. We would
like to identify \(Df(p)[v] \in \mathbb{R}^m\).

By the definition of derivatives in higher dimensions,
\[\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\|f(p + h) - f(p) - \Lambda h\|}{\| h \|} = 0. \]
So, by letting \(t \in \mathbb{R}\), we have \begin{align*}
  0 & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\|f(p + tv) - f(p) - \Lambda (tv)\|}{\| tv \|}\\
    & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\|f(p + tv) - f(p) - t\Lambda v\|}{\left| t \right|}\\
    & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\|f(p + tv) - f(p)\|}{\left|t\right|} - 
        \Lambda v,\\
\end{align*} So,
\(\lim_{t \to 0} \|f(p + tv) - f(p)\| / \left|t\right| = \Lambda v\).
Thus, by finding the limits of the above equation for each basis vector
\(v \in B\), we find the Jacobian \([\Lambda]_B\).

\begin{remark}
  For notation, we denote the limit as 
  \(\lim_{t \to 0} \|f(p + tv) - f(p)\| / \left|t\right|\) as 
  \(\partial f / \partial v \mid_p\) and we call it the directional derivative 
  of \(f\) in the direction of \(v\) at \(p\). We will normally consider the 
  directional derivatives in the direction of the standard basis and we call 
  them the partial derivatives of \(f\) at \(p\).
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
  Let \(\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) be open, and 
  \(f : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^m : x \mapsto [f_i(x)]\) for 
  \(i \in \{1, \cdots m\}\) is differentiable at some \(p \in \Omega\). Then 
  the Jacobian of \(f\) at \(p\) is \([\partial f_i / \partial e_j \mid_p]_{i, j}\).
\end{theorem} 
\proof

We recall that the Jacobian is simply the matrix form of the linear map
that is the derivative. So, for all \(v \in \mathbb{R}^n\), we have
\(J v = Df(p)(v)\). As, \(v \in \mathbb{R}^n\), it can be represented as
a sum of the standard basis, that is there exists
\(v_i \in \mathbb{R}\), \(v = \sum_{i = 1}^n v_i e_i\), so,
\(Df(p)(v) = Df(p)(\sum_{i = 1}^n v_i e_i)  = \sum_{i = 1}^n v_i Df(p)(e_i)  = \sum_{i = 1}^n v_i \partial f / \partial e_i \mid_p  = [\sum_{i = 1}^n v_i \partial f_j / \partial e_i \mid_p]_j  = [\partial f_i / \partial e_j \mid_p]_{i, j} v\).
(We used the fact that
\([\partial f / \partial e_i]_j  = \partial f_j / \partial e_i\).) \qed
